title: About me
---
I am currently studying data science at Lambda School, having graduated at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with a BA in English: Literature. I am particularly interested in working in a few different areas: psychology and natural resources.

I have always tried to solve problems with data, hoping to gather enough information to find patterns and make observations that would lead to solutions for the world's ills (or maybe just my own).
